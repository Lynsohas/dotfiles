In addition to the obvious programs mentioned in directory names in this repo I also use a great number of smaller programs that don't need any custom configuration after installation. This file will be an attempt to list any such software to make new installations easier.

FZF
ranger_devicons
powerline
nerd-fonts (includes powerline symbols)
cower (aur installations)
compton (mainly to fix the round corners of the top bar)
